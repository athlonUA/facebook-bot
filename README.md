# Facebook bot

For now it's a simple implementation of huge project

## Setup

- For the first you need to create [facebook messenger app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start)
- Next you need to create room on your Slack team and get it `id`
- At the end you need to fill `config.js` file with your credentials

## How it works

- Type something and you see your text in bot response
- Type `human` to establish connection with Slack
- Type `return` to break the connection with Slack
